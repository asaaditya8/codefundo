## Fraud-proof Voting Platform

We will be creating a platform for voting using Azure Blockchain to prevent fraud votes.

How are we going to do it?

We will be using fingerprint and face authentication to verify voterâ€™s identity (since the government created the Aadhaar Database which has both). We will also send the voter a confirmation message, which can be used to complain against fraud. Using blockchain will make the system immune to hacking.
